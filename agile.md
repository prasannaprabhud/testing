Agile methodology is a **way of developing software** that focuses on **speed, flexibility, and continuous improvement**. Instead of doing everything in a big phase (like Waterfall), Agile breaks work into **small parts** and delivers results step-by-step.

### **Key ideas**

* **Iterative development** → Work is done in **small cycles** (called iterations or sprints).
* **Customer involvement** → Customer gives feedback often.
* **Flexible to change** → Requirements can change anytime.
* **Team collaboration** → Team works closely together.
* **Continuous improvement** → After every sprint, team reviews and improves.

### **Common Agile frameworks**

1. **Scrum**

   * Uses **Sprints** (usually 2 weeks)
   * Roles: **Product Owner, Scrum Master, Development Team**
   * Events: **Daily Stand-up, Sprint Planning, Review, Retrospective**

2. **Kanban**

   * Uses a **visual board** (To-Do → In Progress → Done)
   * Improves workflow without fixed sprints.

3. **XP (Extreme Programming)**

   * Focus on **coding practices** (pair programming, test-driven development).

### **Why Agile is used**

* Faster delivery
* Fewer bugs (due to continuous testing)
* Better customer satisfaction
* Easy to handle changing requirements

### **Where Agile is used**

* Software development teams
* Testing teams
* Product companies (Google, Amazon, Meta, etc.)
