Here’s a clear, simple explanation of **testing** and its **types**, especially useful for software development:

---

## **What is Testing?**

Testing is the process of checking whether a software application works correctly, meets requirements, and has no defects.

---

## **Types of Testing**

### **1. Manual Testing**

Testing done by humans without using tools.

* Exploratory Testing
* Ad-hoc Testing
* Usability Testing

### **2. Automation Testing**

Testing done using scripts/tools.

* Selenium
* Playwright
* Cypress

---

## **Based on Knowledge Level**

### **3. Black Box Testing**

Tester doesn’t know internal code.
Examples:

* Functional testing
* System testing

### **4. White Box Testing**

Tester knows the internal code.
Examples:

* Unit testing
* Code coverage testing

### **5. Grey Box Testing**

Partial knowledge of internal system.

---

## **Based on Functionality**

### **6. Functional Testing**

Checks what the system does.
Includes:

* Unit Testing
* Integration Testing
* System Testing
* UAT (User Acceptance Testing)

### **7. Non-Functional Testing**

Checks how the system behaves.
Includes:

* Performance Testing
* Load Testing
* Stress Testing
* Security Testing
* Compatibility Testing

---

## **Other Types**

### **8. Regression Testing**

Check if new changes break old features.

### **9. Smoke Testing**

Basic checks to see if the build is stable.

### **10. Sanity Testing**

Quick testing to verify one small feature fix.

### **11. Alpha & Beta Testing**

* Alpha → internal testing
* Beta → tested by real users before launch
